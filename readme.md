# .NET 9 Upgrade

This is a fork of the orginal project that is upgraded to .net 9.  Seems the original project has gone quite so I am maintaining this here.  Note this no longer supports Silverlight so if that is something you need, stick with the original.

# Welcome to Kaxaml!

Kaxaml is a lightweight XAML editor that gives you a "split view" so you can see both your XAML and your rendered content (kind of like XamlPad but without the gigabyte of SDK). Kaxaml is a hobby and was created to be shared, so it's free!

Kaxaml is designed to be "notepad for XAML." It's supposed to be simple and lightweight and make it easy to just try something out. It also has some basic support for intellisense and some fun plugins (including one for snippets, one for cleaning up your XAML and for rendering your XAML to an image).
