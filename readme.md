# Welcome to Kaxaml!

Kaxaml is a lightweight XAML editor that gives you a "split view" so you can see both your XAML and your rendered content (kind of like XamlPad but without the gigabyte of SDK). Kaxaml is a hobby and was created to be shared, so it's free!

Kaxaml is designed to be "notepad for XAML." It's supposed to be simple and lightweight and make it easy to just try something out. It also has some basic support for intellisense and some fun plugins (including one for snippets, one for cleaning up your XAML and for rendering your XAML to an image).

| *Tag Edit Auto Matching Feature added in this Fork* |

The big movtivation for this fork was the fact that the orginal project has been quiet for so many years.  I did not want to see if wither away as it is such a fantastic application - kudos to the  devs who put all of that effort into it.

First thing I did was upgrade to .NET 9.  While at it, I took the liberty of performing significant code cleanup and modernization.  I also fixed several annoying little bugs and added features I have always wished for.  No real roadmap to speak of, just fixing and adding things as they come up.

Note that this no longer supports Silverlight so if that is something you need, stick with the original.

I welcome any feedback.
